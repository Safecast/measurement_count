Measurement Count example
-------------------------

This project shows how to use Safecast's API to insert the current measurement count into an html document.

Because of limitations in the API, it currently only works on sites that have a safecast.org domain.



In this example, the AJAX method gets called in the body onLoad.  In your use case, you may want to use something like jQuery to call the AJAX method on document.ready
